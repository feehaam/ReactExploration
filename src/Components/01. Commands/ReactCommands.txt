Before getting started, make sure you install node.js and npm in your machine and check their versions:

node -v
JavaScript
npm –version
JavaScript
If npm and node.js is installed on computer, install create-react-app globally with the command below:

npm install –g create-react-app
JavaScript
Creation of project − to create a project once above commands are executed, run the below command:

npx create-react-app hello-world-example
JavaScript
npx comes with npm version 5.2+ . The npm version can be checked on terminal using:

npm –version
JavaScript
If the npm version is 5.2+, then the react.js project can be directly created with the command:

npx create-react-app hello-world-example
JavaScript
If npm version is 6+, then execute this command below:

npm init react-app hello-world
JavaScript
With yarn, we have command:

yarn create react-app hello-world-example
JavaScript
Once above commands are inserted, change the directory to hello-world-example.

With create-react-app, webpack or babel is required for using advanced JavaScript features, which are preconfigured. We can only concentrate on writing code.

cd hello-world-example
JavaScript
To execute the application, run the below command on terminal:

npm start
JavaScript
npm start runs a live development server, and the code changes will automatically refresh the browser and reflect the changes.
